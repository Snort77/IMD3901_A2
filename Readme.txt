Assignment 2

This is the first Assignment in Aframe. In this game I made you have one task. and that is to defeat gumby before he defeats you. 
The game starts right when the tab the scene is loaded. In it you face a button but to your right there is a giant Gumby moving towards you!
If you press the button a large red ball will appear in between you and gumby and if you click on it the ball will be launched towards gumby
dealing damage to him! Now there are 2 outcomes for the game either gumby wins or you win. sadly I did not make an easy way to restart
so the tab must be reloaded to try again. both endings end with walls spawning around the the main area with text telling you if you won
or lost. To defeat gumby you must throw 10 balls at him but if he reaches you before you can do this you will lose. Also there is music 
that makes gumby a lot scarier and there is a sound that plays when you win but sadly it only seemed to play audio in Internet Explorer.

I had a lot of troubles with this project. I am not the best a coding and I did not realize how difficult it would be for me too switch to 
another language (plus we are doing python in another class right now). I had a lot of troubles figuring out how each event was written and 
how to use them since the A-frame only some of the information on each page it took me a while to wrap my head around it. But I specificly
had difficulty in javascript and making sure all the connections worked between html and javasript. I also had technical difficulties with
my oculus so I was not able to test it in vr at home.

I am happy with the tools for graphics, I was able to import the gumby model I made over the break for fun and I am excited to try making more 
assets for future projects. I ran into a lot of issues and I did solve most problems myself but some odd situations occured such as my lack 
in knowledge of javascript I had to get help from Anthony the professor but he was very helpful. For the most part I am happy with how it turned
out, I know its a little weird and I feel I can do more with the assets used such as making or finding more models instead of using all the 
primitives.
